== Description ==

Ghostwriter overrides WordPress’s author pages and feeds to emulate the full functionality provided to WordPress users. Ghostwriter was developed by Floate in Melbourne. Just north of the river.

== When to use Ghostwriter ==

Ghostwriter is best used for a blog written by multiple staff members but with a single person performing data entry.

Ghostwriter works when the writing and approval process operates outside of the WordPress dashboard. If approval is done within the dashboard, setting up users as contributors may be better.
